        <p class="housing">
            There are 4 schools of rabbit housing. The first is for the house rabbit. These are pet rabbits that have the run of the house. What most people don't realize is that rabbits are easily trained to use a litter box, in most cases this can be easier than house training a dog but like with anything there are some expectations. The second is called colony raising where rabbits, both male and female, live together in a large space. Surprisingly when raised that way they won't over run you with babies but will actually self-regulate when they have litters. Some males have even been known to watch after and help care for the young kits once they are old enough to leave their mother's nest. The third school is cage raising. This is where rabbits are kept in cages, the size of cage and set up can vary by breeder but at a minimum females are in a 32" x 32" with males in a 28" x 32". The fourth school is a hybrid of the colony and cage set ups. The males and females are kept in separate cages but the females have larger cages allowing for 2 bonded females to live together and raise their babies together. There are several variations to this depending on what works best for the breeder.        </p>
        <p class="food">
            Feeding your rabbit can be done in a variety of ways but you do want to make sure that whatever you do for feeding, it gives your rabbit a balanced diet. The easiest way to feed your rabbit is to go to a feed store and get rabbit pellets. I wouldn't recommend going to the pet store as they are usually too expensive and their pellets can include a mix of things that are not good for your rabbit. Some people prefer a more fresh diet consisting of stuff foraged from the garden or around the home supplemented with a good grass hay. When doing the foraging method please do your research as some things can be harmful to rabbits. There is a good book called 'Beyond the pellet' that gives a lot of alternatives for rabbit feeding. People have been raising rabbits for centuries, but pellets only became available after World War II. There is a book called 'Keeping poultry and rabbits on scraps' that was written during the war that tells how to keep rabbits on kitchen scraps and other things that are readily available. While it may not apply at this time it is still good to read and full of good ideas.
