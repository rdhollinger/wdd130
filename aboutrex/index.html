            This page is about rabbits. Rex rabbits in particular as they are my favorite. All rabbits are cute but they do have other purposes in life besides being a pet. There are so many things, they can make good therapy animals, they can also be used for food, and clothing. There are even some that train for jumping competitions. Rabbits were domesticated hundreds of years ago, supposedly by french monks, declaring them a type of fish and therefore edible during lent. For years they have been a source of food for those who lived in urban areas and those that didnâ€™t have the land to raise something like a cow or pig. 1 buck and 2 does can produce almost as much meat as a steer but only needing about a quarter of the feed. During World War 2 people were encouraged to raise rabbits as they provided a source of meat and could be raised off of kitchen scraps.

            Just keep in mind that rabbits aren't an easy starter pet. They require much more care than a cat or a dog. Also it can be hard to find a good exotic animal vet that can handle them and vet costs will be higher than that of a dog or a cat. You also have to be very careful what they eat.  They can be a very satisfying animal to have in your care though. Through this site I will give you some information but also a starting point for your own research into rabbits and how they can be a part of your life.
