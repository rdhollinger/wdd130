            The rex rabbit was first domesticated in France from a breed of wild gray rabbit in 1919. The rex was first imported to the United States in 1924.  Rex rabbits were originally bred to be what is called a dual purpose rabbit. They were bred for both fur and meat. I know you ask 'How can you eat such a cute animal?' but think back through the ages. Even as far back as 60 or 70 years ago it wasn't always easy to get meat, especially if you are on the poorer end of the spectrum. Even now meat is one of the most expensive items to buy at a grocery store. Rabbits are an inexpensive way to get meat and are better for you then chicken as they are a very lean protein. They don't take a lot of space to raise, making them easy to raise even in big cities where you might have limited space. They are also quiet and with proper care don't smell like a chicken would.

            The standard for rex rabbits is that they have plush, velvet like fur (Yes I love to pet them, they are so soft). An adult male should weigh between 7 1/2 to 9 1/2 pounds with an ideal weight of 8 pounds. An adult female should weigh between 8 and 10 1/2 pounds with an ideal weight of 9 pounds. They come in over 15 colors, as well as what is called broken. Meaning they are a white coat with colored spots and the spots can be any of the over 15 colors.
            If you would like to find out more I would recommend going to the ARBA website. ARBA stands for 'American Rabbit Breeders Association'. Through their website you can see lots of different breeds of rabbits and also get information on registered breeders. It will also let you look up rabbit shows in your area. I would recommend going to a show for anyone looking to get rabbits. It allows you to see lots of different breeds and talk to the breeders. This is a good way to get information and decide if rabbits are right for you and what breed would be right for you.
