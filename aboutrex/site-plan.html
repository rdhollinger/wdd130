        Welcome. This page is about rabbits. Rex rabbits inperticular as they are my favorite. All rabbits are cute but they do have other purposes in life besides being a pet. 
        There are so many things, they can make good therapy animals, they can also be used for food, and clothing. There are even some that are train for jumping compitions.
        Just keep in mind that rabbits aren't an easy starter pet. They reqire much more care then a cat or a dog. They can be a very satisfing animal to have in your care though.
        Through this site I will give you some information but also a starting point for your own research into rabbits and how they can be apart of your life.

      <h3>About the rex</h3>
      <p>
        Rex rabbits where orginally bred to be what is called a dual pupose rabbit. They were bred for both fur and meat. I know you ask 'How can you eat such a cute animal?'
        but think back through the ages. Even as far back as 60 or 70 years ago it wasn't always easy to get meat, espically if you are on the poorer end of the spectrum. Even
        now meat is one of the most expensive items to buy at a grocery store. Rabbits are an inexpensive way to get meat and are better for you then chicken as they are a very
        lean protien. They don't take a lot of space to raise, making them easy to raise even in big cities where you might have limited space. They are also quite and with proper
        care don't smell like a chicken would. A buck and 2 does can produce the same amount of meat as a cow in a year. To feed these rabbits though only takes about 1/4 of what
        a cow would need to come up to butcher weight. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The standard for rex rabbits is that they have plush, velvet like fur (Yes I love to pet them, they are so soft). An adult male should weight between 7 1/2 to 9 1/2 pounds
        with an ideal weight of 8 pounds. An adult female should weight between 8 and 10 1/2 pounds with an ideal weight of 9 pounds. They come in over 15 colors, as well as what
        is called broken. Meaning they are a white coat with colored spots and the spots can be any of the over 15 colors. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If you would like to find out more I would recommend going to the ARBA website. ARBA stands for 'American Rabbit Breeders Association'. Through their website you can
        see lots of different breeds of rabbits and also get information on registered breeders. It will also let you look up rabbit shows in your area. I would recommed going to 
        a show for anyone looking to get rabbits. It allows you to see lots of different breeds and talk to the breeders. This is a good way to get information and decide weather
        rabbits are right for you and what breed would be right for you.

      <h3>Rabbit Care</h3>
      <p>
        There are 4 schools of rabbit housing. The first is for the house rabbit. These are pet rabbits that have the run of the house. What most people don't realize is that 
        rabbits are easily trained to use a litter box, in most cases this can be easier then house training a dog but like with anything there are some expections. The second is
        called colony raising where rabbits, both male and female, live together in a large space. Surpisingly when raised that way they won't over run you with babies but will 
        actually self-regulate when they have litters. Some males have even been known to watch after and help care for the young kits once they are old enough to leave their 
        mother's nest. The third school is cage raising. This is where rabbits are kept in cages, the size of cage and set up can very by breeder but at a minum females are in a
        32" x 32" with males in a 28" x 32". The fourth school is a hybred of the colony and cage set ups. The males and females are kept in seperate cages but the females have
        larger cages allowing for 2 bonded females to live together and raise their babies together. There are several veriations to this depending on what works best for the breeder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feeding your rabbit can be done in a verity of ways but you do want to make sure that whatever you do for feeding, it gives your rabbit a balanced diet. The easiest
        way to feed your rabbit is to go to a feed store and get rabbit pellets. I wouldn't recommend going to the pet stor as they are usually to expensive and their pellets
        can include a mix of things that are not good for your rabbit. Some people prefer a more fresh diet consisting of stuff foraged from the garden or around the home
        suplimented with a good grass hay. When doing the foraging method please do your research as some things can be harmful to rabbits. There is a good book called
        'Beyond the pellet' that gives a lot of alternitives for rabbit feeding. People have been raising rabbits for centuries, but pellets only became available after World
        War II. There is a book called 'Keeping poltury and rabbits on scraps' that was written during the war that tells how to keep rabbits on kitchen scrapes and other things
        that are readily available. While it may not apply at this time it is still good to read and full of good ideas.
