    <h2>Rachael Hollinger</h2>
    <p>I currently live in Idaho on the west coast of the USA near Twin Falls with my parents as their caretaker. We moved her 2 years ago to be closer to my siblings,
    I'm the youngest of 7. I'm working on an applied tech degree with a focus on network admininastration. I don't currently work as I am focusing on getting my degree.</p>
    <p>I like to do crafting and specialize in hand embroidery, cross stitch and quilting. I also know how to knitt, chochet, native american style beading, and leather tooling.
    I also raise rabbits and am currently expecting a litter of babies that are due anyday now. We also have 2 dogs and a cat.</p>
    <p>I look forward to learning about website building and can see where it will be a useful skill to have, even if it's just for my own personal use.</p>
